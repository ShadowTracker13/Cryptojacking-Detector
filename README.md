Python Code for Cryptojacking Detector

This script monitors CPU usage and checks running processes for known cryptojacking behaviors.

Features:
1. Monitors CPU usage for suspicious spikes.
2. Identifies processes consuming excessive CPU resources.
3. Checks network connections for links to cryptocurrency mining pools.
4. Alerts the user if a potential cryptojacking attempt is detected.


How It Works:
1. The script monitors CPU usage for unusual spikes.
2. It identifies processes using excessive CPU power.
3. It checks active network connections for links to known cryptojacking domains.
4. Alerts the user if suspicious activity is detected.

Next Steps: Want to improve the script?
- Add machine learning for better detection.
- Create an automated response to terminate mining processes.
